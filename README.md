# java_app_open_save_txt_file


This is the very first program that i learned using Swing.
The program is very basic.
If you are wondering, this program primarily does two tasks:
i> open the txt file that is saved in any directory; you need to provide directory information in textField and hit the button <<OPEN>>.
ii> write/edit the txt file that already exist; provide the txt file directory that you want to modify.
